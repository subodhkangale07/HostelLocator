## Getting Started

>**Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server
Metro is the JavaScript _bundler_ used in React Native. Start Metro by running the following command in your project root directory:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application
Keep Metro running in its own terminal and open another terminal in your project root. Use the commands below to start your app.

#### For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

> If everything is set up correctly, your app should launch in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.
